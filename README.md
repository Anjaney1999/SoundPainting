# SoundPainting
# Sound Painting with LEAP motion
- The program intends to synthesise sounds similar to a musical activity called Sound Painting.
- Although the sign language is not entirely similar, the idea was inspired by the concept of Sound Painting, where the "painter" makes dialogues with sections of an orchestra.
- This project consists of 6 sections of an orchestra, uses leap motion to combine the most common signs in sound painting, and pyGame is used to play the resulting sound.
# This project was developed in Python, used the LeapMotion Python API and pyGame with Soundbanks.
